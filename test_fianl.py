The program displays three main functions;
the number of grades, the class average, and the % of grades > average.

using the "Final.txt" file we;
first open print the total number of grades = "num_grades" found on the file
add up the sum of all "grades" found in file
by dividing the sum of "grades" by the "num_grades" we get "class_avg"
print class average "class_avg" to user
using the "class_avg" the program can then output the % of grades that are > average

the functions will output the number of grades
then loop through the scores and output a class average
and finaly, loop and output the % of all grades that are > average
